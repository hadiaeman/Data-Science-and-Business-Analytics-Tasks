# Data-Science-and-Business-Analytics-Tasks
Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis on Global Terrorism Dataset

Tools Used
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Analysis
Data Loading and Initial Inspection

Loaded the Global Terrorism Database into a Pandas DataFrame.
Inspected the structure of the dataset, including columns, data types, and missing values.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Handled missing or inconsistent data, ensuring data integrity for analysis.
Formatted columns and converted data types as necessary for meaningful analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Hot Zones Identification: Identified regions and countries with the highest number of terrorist incidents using geographical plots and heatmaps.
Types of Attacks: Analyzed the frequency of different types of terrorist attacks and determined the most common methods.
Casualties Analysis: Investigated trends in casualties over time and by region.
Organizations Involved: Identified key terrorist organizations responsible for significant incidents.
Success Rate of Attacks: Evaluated the success rate of terrorist attacks based on their impact and objectives.
Results and Insights
Hot Zones: Middle East, South Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and South America are identified as regions with high terrorism activity.
Types of Attacks: Bombings, armed assaults, and kidnappings are the most common.
Casualties: Trends show variability influenced by geopolitical factors and counter-terrorism measures.
Key Organizations: ISIS, Al-Qaeda, Boko Haram, and the Taliban are identified as major terrorist organizations.
Success Rate: Highlighted the importance of effective security measures in reducing the success rate of terrorist attacks.

Task 2: Decision Tree Classification on Iris Dataset

Tools Used
Python: Programming language used for analysis.
Libraries: Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
Analysis
Data Loading and Preparation

Loaded the Iris dataset and prepared the feature matrix X and target vector y.

Data Splitting

Split the dataset into training and testing sets with a 70-30 ratio.

Model Training

Created and trained a Decision Tree classifier on the training data.

Model Evaluation

Predicted the classes of the test set and calculated the model's accuracy.

Model Visualization

Visualized the Decision Tree to understand the decision-making process.
Results

Accuracy: The Decision Tree classifier achieved an accuracy of approximately 1.00 on the test set.

Visualization: The Decision Tree provided insights into the decision-making process, showing feature importance and thresholds used for classification.

Conclusion
This report presents the results of an EDA on the Global Terrorism Database and a Decision Tree classification on the Iris dataset. The EDA provides valuable insights into global terrorism patterns, identifying hot zones, common attack types, casualty trends, key organizations, and attack success rates. The Decision Tree classification demonstrates the effectiveness of this model for classifying iris species with high accuracy. Both analyses underscore the importance of data-driven approaches in security and machine learning applications.
